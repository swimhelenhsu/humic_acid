## Abstract
This semester, samples of HA at 5 mg/L, 10 mg/L and 15 mg/L and concentrations of clay at 10 NTU, 100 NTU and 100 NTU are tested separately to find the respective absorbances. The individual absorbances recorded are used to compare with the mixture of different concentrations of clay and HA to find the additive aspects of the mixture.  The results of these tests will investigate how absorbance and spectrophotometry can be used to quantify the concentrations of humic acid and clay in water mixtures.  This capabilitiy can impact the ways AguaClara plants measure and test the efficiency of current and improved processes.

**[Talk a little bit more about how this fits into AguaClara as a whole perhaps so it's more interesting and stimulating as to why this is important.]**

## Introduction
Natural Organic Matter (NOM) exists in ground and surface waters with various chemical compositions. It is dipolar, which means that it is an electrically neutral molecule carrying a positive and negative charge. This characteristic allows intermolecular forces with neighboring molecules. NOM can serve as a nutrient for bacteria, viruses, and pathogens, encouraging their re-germination processes. Additionally, NOM produces carcinogenic by-products during the degradation process. It then becomes imperative to remove NOM in water. The amount of NOM in raw water supplies is greater in areas such as Northern Europe and North America. However, there isn't a robust model predicting how NOM behaves in water and thus, there are not effective treatment methods for NOM removal. Limited knowledge in this area affects drinking water treatment significantly. Many researchers believe the role of NOM in water might call for a need to increase coagulant doses.


The Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam investigated the optimal coagulant dosage for certain humic acid inffluent concentrations and results are shown in Table 1 below:

Table 1: Results from Spring 2018 Humic Acid Team




| Humic Acid Concentration(mg/L) | Optimal Coagulant Dosage(mg/L) |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 5                              | 1.6-1.8                        |
| 10                             | 1.3                            |


Even though the humic acid concentration doubled, the difference between optimal coagulant dosages was negligible. Therefore, the Team decided to change our research path. Instead of continuing to test optimal coagulant dosage for different humic acid concentrations, the Fall 2018 Team investigated how effluent humic acid concentration changes as coagulant dosage increases at a certain humic acid influent concentration.  With more available information of NOM in local water supplies, AguaClara could better adjust the coagulant dosage to achieve lower effluent turbidities and save money on coagulant.

In terms of importance to the world in general, the coagulant concentration should not be too high because it is expensive and potentially harmful to the water quality. Too much coagulant will prevent flocculation which is counter-productive. Too little coagulant means the water still potentially has significant levels of humic acid, which will be problematic once chlorine is used to kill bacteria in the water. The humic acid and chlorine will react to form chloroform which is very harmful to humans (Kopfler,et. al.).

## Literature Review
NOM negatively affects water quality in a number of ways. It causes discoloration, taste and odor problems, and biological growth in distribution systems. It also increases the concentration of heavy metals and absorbed organic pollutants. The increased particles in water consequently cause an increase in sludge volumes. Matilainen et al.(2010) suggests that optimized coagulation is the major treatment option in decreasing NOM level. However, the nature of NOM has significant effects on the removal efficiency of coagulation. Additionally, the hydrophobic portion of NOM is generally removed more effectively with coagulation than the hydrophilic portion is. The removal efficiency of NOM also depends on several factors such as pH, temperature and coagulant type.

Regarding NOM removal efficiency, Soh et al.(2008) isolated dissolved NOM into four organic fractions based on their hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties (very hydrophobic acids, slightly hydrophobic acids, charged hydrophilics, and neutral hydrophilics). His experiment was designed to determine the impact of alum coagulation on removal of these fractions in conventional water treatment. He found that the alum removed mostly hydrophobic and higher molecular weight components of NOM. This result further verified that the NOM removal efficiency is correlated with the properties of NOM. His study also revealed that, even though alum coagulation removed a large proportion of NOM, a significant amount of the NOM resisted coagulation as well. This implies that NOM removal will not improve significantly at very high coagulant dosage.

Because of the aforementioned factors, such as pH value, that influence NOM removal efficiency, the team needed to design well-controlled experiments to avoid any unexpected variables affecting experimental results. The studies that have been conducted in related fields provide inspiration for experiments the team conducted this semester, such as exploring the optimal coagulant dosage (the dosage which yields the lowest effluent turbidity) at a certain humic acid concentration. Previous research focused on the general effect of coagulation on humic acid and the subcomponents of NOM, but there have been no comprehensive studies conducted on optimal dosages. Therefore, the primary focus was on the optimal dosage of coagulant.

More relevant research **[Grammar?]** to the current Humic Acid Team is from Yingda Du (2017), a former graduate student at Cornell. Du was the first to experiment with how effluent turbidity is affected by a combination of coagulant concentration and humic acid concentration. Her thesis paper investigates the effects NOM has on flocculation. Particle size distribution of flocs and effluent turbidity are the two major criteria for determining the effectiveness of flocculation. These two parameters are affected by the concentration of NOM in the system. In order to model this system, humic acid, which is one of the major components of NOM, serves as the surrogate for NOM. Du hypothesized that variation in humic acid concentration will affect floc size distribution and effluent turbidity. In her thesis, she modeled the effects of humic acid in high turbidity water on flocculation. For influent turbidity at 50 NTU with coagulant dosage ranging from 0.53 mg/L to 2.65 mg/L and humic acid concentration ranging from 0 to 15 mg/L, a series of experiments from Yingda indicate that the coagulant dosage is positively correlated with turbidity reduction and the presence of humic acid greatly increases the effluent turbidity. This was same for every experiment. An increase in coagulant dosage decreased the settled water turbidity.

Another finding from Du's report is that the presence of humic acid increases the frequency of smaller particles after flocculation. As humic acid coats coagulant nano-particles, the attachment efficiency of collisions will decrease. Thus, humic acid can change the particle size distribution of the precipitated solids and larger particle formation is greatly inhibited by humic acid. This result indicates that existence of humic acid particles could diminish the performance of flocculation/sedimentation process with higher effluent turbidity.


## Previous Work
The Humic Acid Team was established in Fall 2017 and in that semester, the team members tested the optimal coagulant dosage at 5 mg/L humic acid influent concentration and obtained 1.6 mg/L as the optimal coagulant dosage.

The Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam verified the previous semester's result and tested optimal coagulant dosages for 5m/L and 10 mg/L HA concentrations. The results are shown in Table 1 above. As the HA concentration increases, the optimal coagulant dosage drops down slightly. However, the team cannot conclude that the increasing of HA concentration will decrease the optimal coagulant dosage, as a wider range of HA concentrations should be tested. In addition, the team found that for one trial, the head loss through the flocculator accumulates with time. This phenomenon might explain why the effluent turbidity rises up again after the experiment reaches steady state.


The Fall 2018 Humic Acid subteam introduced the spectrophotomer into the experimental apparatus.  This was done in order to investigate the applicability of UV-spectroscopy in quantifying the concentration of humic acid in water streams.  The team ran several tests with humic acid (HA for short) solutions of 5 mg/L, 10 mg/L, and 15 mg/L through the 1600 UV spectrophotometer in the design lab at 254 nm. Results from this first preliminary test showed that there is a linear relationship between absorbance and humic acid concentration (equation of the line found to be $$ y=0.0453x+0.0351 $$ through linear regression; y is absorbance, x is concentration of HA).This result proved that HA solution obeyed Beer's Law, and spectrsocopy could be used to determine humic acid concentration. Humic acid solutions were then run through the AccuView spectrophotomer and an absorbance curve was plotted. The final preliminary experiment conducted was done with clay.

Figure 1 was created by python code and code can be found in the "Python Code" section.

Clay mixtures were run through the turbidity meter and spectrophotmeter.  Results showed that the turbidity and absorbance of clay were related linearly. The relationship was obtained: $$ y=0.0199x+0.0554 $$, where y is the absorbance and x is the turbidity of clay.This relationship implies by measuring the effluent turbidity of a clay sample, the absorbance of clay can be calculated using the equation above. Fall 2018's work in using absorbance gives future teams data for future spectroscopy work.**[Please watch for tenses]**

## Methods
#### Experimental Methods
The Spring 2019 HA Team assembled a recycled system (Figure 3) to eliminate any potential disturbances in running tap water. Because there were constant complications with the spectrophotometer in past semesters, the team decided to start with verifying absorbance results of HA at the same concentrations tested before. In the new system, samples at 5 mg/L, 10 mg/L and 15 mg/L were tested, recorded and compared with past results.

Additionally, in previous experiments, clay turbidity was controlled by ProCoda. In order to know the exact concentration of clay within the system, the second set of experiments focused on achieving 10 NTU, 100 NTU, 1000 NTU readings and measuring the amount of clay used, and verifying whether the relationship between clay concentration and absorbance held true for a recycled system.

The last set of experiments tested a mixture of clay at 10 NTU, 100 NTU, 1000 NTU, with HA at 5 mg/L. In the second set of experiments, the exact amount of clay associated with different concentrations was determined and can be directly used in this step. The readings on the turbidimeter and spectrophotometer were recorded.

#### Mixture

Figure 4: The observed and projected absorbance of 5 mg/L of humic acid with clay.  The projected absorbance is the absorbance of the mixture in the case where the total absorbance is the pure sum of 5 mg/L humic acid and the corresponding clay absorbance at a given NTU.  **[watch tenses please]**The absorbance of the mixture at low turbidity is close to the projected value, but higher concentrations of clay exhibit no specific relationship.

Table 4: Projected absorbances and observed absorbances for 5 mg/L of humic acid streams


|  Projected Additive Absorbance |   Actual Additive Absorbance  |    Percentage Difference    |                
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------| ----------------------------|
|0.2826                          |0.3138                         |11.04%                       |
|0.4596                          |0.5541                         |20.56%                       |
|1.1356                          |2                              |76.12%                       |


As seen in table 4's data, **[captialize table and figures]** that at low turbidities, the projected absorbances - the absorbance of pure humic acid added with the absorbance of clay - are approximately equal to the observed absorbance of the mixture influent. However, as NTU increased, the ideal projected absorbance diverged quickly with the observed absorbances. This suggests that there are humic-acid clay interactions present that do not allow for mixture absorbances to be strictly additive.

Figure 5: The observed and projected absorbance of 10 mg/L of humic acid with clay.  The projected absorbance is the absorbance of the mixture in the case where the total absorbance is the pure sum of 10 mg/L humic acid and the corresponding clay absorbance at a given NTU.  The absorbance of the mixture at low NTU is close to the projected value, but higher concentrations of clay exhibit no specific relationship.

Table 5: Projected absorbances and observed absorbances for 10 mg/L of humic acid streams


|  Projected Additive Absorbance |   Actual Additive Absorbance  |    Percentage Difference    |                
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------| ----------------------------|
|0.4829                          |0.4898                         |1.4%                         |
|0.6599                          |0.8031                         |21.7%                        |
|1.3359                          |2                              |49.71%                       |


Similar to the results of the 5 mg/L humic acid mixture stream, the projected absorbances are approximately equal to the observed absorbance of the mixture influent.  Again, however, the projected absorbance quickly became a poor approximation as NTU increased.  This further suggests that there are interactions between humic acid and clay that affect absorbance readings.

<img src="https://github.com/AguaClara/humic_acid/blob/master/15%20mg%20per%20L%20HA%20Clay%20Mix.png?raw=true" height=250 width=400>

Figure 6: The observed and projected absorbance of 15 mg/L of humic acid with clay.  The projected absorbance is the absorbance of the mixture in the case where the total absorbance is the pure sum of 15 mg/L humic acid and the corresponding clay absorbance at a given NTU.  The absorbance of the mixture is not close to the projected value at any NTU of clay.

Table 6: Projected absorbances and observed absorbances for 15 mg/L of humic acid streams


|  Projected Additive Absorbance |   Actual Additive Absorbance  |    Percentage Difference    |                
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------| ----------------------------|
|0.6409                          |0.537                          |16%                          |
|0.8179                          |0.818                          |0.1%                         |
|1.4939                          |2                              |33.88%                       |


The 15 mg/L humic acid mixture streams exhibited a different behaviour in comparison to the 5 and 10 mg/L humic acid mixture streams.  At the lowest turbidity, the observed absorbances for the 15 mg/L humic acid mixture streams were not equal to the projected absorbance. However, the mixture with 100 NTU clay and humic acid had only 0.1% of a difference in absorbance in comparison with the projected absorbance. For 15 mg/L humic acid mixtures, only partial results confirmed the additive assumptions of absorbance. More experiments need to be conducted in order to reach a conclusion.

The results of these three tests were compiled into two separate graphs (see Figures 7 and 8 below).  Figure 7 displays the measured/predicted absorbance vs. the varying clay turbidity tested.  Figure 8 displays the measured/predicted absorbance vs. the humic acid concentrations tested.  As seen in Figure 7, the measured/predicted absorbance ratio has no real correlation with turbidity.  In Figure 8, however, the accuracy seems to decrease with increasing humic acid concentration, but more data is needed to conclude the observation.

Note that the data of trials with turbidities over 1000 NTU were not included because of the inaccurate readings (absorbance was maxed out at 2, so the absorbance of the stream was too high for the spectrophotometer to read).

Figure 7: The ratio of measured absorbance over predicted absorbance vs. clay turbidity.  The slope of zero suggests that the accuracy of the predicted absorbances stays the same regardless of the clay turbidity.

Figure 8: The ratio of measured absorbance over predicted absorbance vs. humic acid concentration.  A negative trend is observed, but more data is needed to see how the accruacy of the predicted absrobances correlates with varying humic acid concentrations.




All three mixture tests have shown results that prove absorbance can be additive when humic acid and clay are mixed together. However, there are more results that overturn this hypothesis. The team used clay at 1000 NTU for the mixture trials in order to consider real-life situations. However, we did not take into account that the meters might not be able to measure accurately at a high turbidity, therefore this might have resulted in a maxed out reading on the spectrophotometer.

## Complications
There were complications in the experiment that could have resulted in discrepancies. Although no problems were encountered during the verification and calibration of the spectrophotometer, absorbance readings fluctuated between the days when experiments were carried out.  This complication persisted even though same streams were flowing through the system as in previous experimental trials (i.e. water, 5 mg/L humic acid).  Absorbances were sometimes 0.1 to 0.2 higher than usual. There were also minor amounts of clay left in tubes after flushing out the systems at high pump speed.  

## Conclusions
The absorbance of humic acid and clay mixture streams are not purely additive. At a low turbidity, mixtures containing all three 5 mg/L, 10 mg/L and 15 mg/L humic acid concentrations were approximately equal to the purely additive, projected absorbance.  As NTU increased, however, the observed absorbance diverged from the projected absorbance.

It is known that humic acid can stick to clay when the two are mixed together.  In theory, the absorbance would become lower than the projected absorbance after the humic acid sticks to the clay, as more light would be able to pass through the mixture.  From the data collected, however, the observed absorbance became higher than the projected absorbance, contradicting previous deductions.  More research is needed to understand why this result occured. No conclusion can be drawn from the experiments as the number of trials done are not enough, and possible comfounding variables are not fully taken into account.

## Future Work
The team will continue to conduct the experiment with a mixture of HA and clay at 500 NTU and 800 NTU. The current results are not sufficient to show any meaningful relationships between humic acid and clay. Influent mixture streams with 1000 NTU have maxed out the readings on the equipment used in the experiment (absorbance maxed out at 2, turbidity meter maxed out at 1100).  Additionally, absorbance values at 500 NTU and 800 NTU of clay will give further insight on the behaviour of the mixture absorbances, as most data gathered has been at lower NTU (10 and 100 NTU).
The team also plans to use centrifugation to investigate the interactions between humic acid and clay, as well as to understand the impacts these interactions have.
